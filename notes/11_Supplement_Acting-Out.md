# üéØ Be the Memory Network!

## Objective:
Work together to act out how an LSTM or GRU processes information step by step. Each person will play a specific role in the network, deciding what to remember, forget, and output.

---

## Background: What Are LSTMs and GRUs?

When working with sequences‚Äîlike sentences, time-series data, or sensor readings‚Äîwe often want a model to remember important information from earlier and use it later.

### üìä LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
LSTMs manage information using three gates:
- **Forget Gate**: Decides how much past information to forget.
- **Input Gate**: Chooses how much of the new input to store.
- **Output Gate**: Decides what information to share as output.

üí° *Think of LSTMs like a complex filing system‚Äîthey keep important memories and discard irrelevant ones.*

### üîÑ GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
GRUs are a simplified version of LSTMs with two gates:
- **Update Gate**: Controls how much old memory to keep.
- **Reset Gate**: Determines how much past information to mix with the new input.

üí° *GRUs are like a quick memory filter‚Äîfaster but less detailed than LSTMs.*

## üé≠ Your Roles in the Network

In groups of 4-5 people, you will act out an LSTM and a GRU. Each person will take on one of these roles:

### For LSTM:
- **Input Provider (x‚Çú)**: Gives a new piece of information.
- **Forget Gate**: Decides how much of the previous memory to erase.
- **Input Gate**: Chooses how much of the new input to keep.
- **Output Gate**: Decides what information is passed to the next step.
- **Memory Tracker**: Updates and carries the memory (cell state and hidden state).

### For GRU:
- **Input Provider (x‚Çú)**: Gives a new piece of information.
- **Reset Gate**: Decides how much old memory to mix with the new input.
- **Update Gate**: Controls how much of the previous memory to keep.
- **Memory Tracker**: Updates and carries the memory (hidden state).

## üìö How to Play the Simulation

1. Form a group and assign roles.
2. Follow the step-by-step process for either the LSTM or GRU below.
3. Communicate clearly‚Äîeach gate should announce its decision before passing the information to the next person.

## üîç Example: Acting Out an LSTM (5 People)

Let‚Äôs walk through a specific example using the phrase:

**Input Sequence**: `"I love myself."`

### Step 1: Time Step 1 ("I")
- **Input Provider (x‚Çú)**:  
  `"I"` is the first input. Passes `x‚Çú = "I"` to the gates.

- **Forget Gate**:  
  No previous memory exists yet, so there is nothing to forget.  
  **Decision**: Forget 0%.

- **Input Gate**:  
  New information is valuable at the start.  
  **Decision**: Keep 100% of `"I"`.

- **Output Gate**:  
  Share `"I"` as output since it is the only word.  
  **Decision**: Output = `"I"`.

- **Memory Tracker**:  
  - **Cell State**: `"I"`  
  - **Hidden State**: `"I"` (output)

‚úÖ **Output so far**: `"I"`

---

### Step 2: Time Step 2 ("love")
- **Input Provider (x‚Çú)**:  
  Passes the next input: `x‚Çú = "love"`.

- **Forget Gate**:  
  Since `"I"` is still relevant, keep most of it.  
  **Decision**: Forget 10% of previous memory.

- **Input Gate**:  
  `"Love"` is important new information.  
  **Decision**: Keep 90% of `"love"`.

- **Output Gate**:  
  We want to highlight both `"I"` and `"love."`  
  **Decision**: Output = `"I love"`.

- **Memory Tracker**:  
  - **Cell State**: `"I + 0.9(love)"`  
  - **Hidden State**: `"I love"` (output)

‚úÖ **Output so far**: `"I love"`

---

### Step 3: Time Step 3 ("myself")
- **Input Provider (x‚Çú)**:  
  Passes the final input: `x‚Çú = "myself"`.

- **Forget Gate**:  
  `"I"` is less important now.  
  **Decision**: Forget 50% of the first memory.

- **Input Gate**:  
  `"Myself"` is very important.  
  **Decision**: Keep 100% of `"myself"`.

- **Output Gate**:  
  Pass the combined knowledge.  
  **Decision**: Output = `"I love myself"`.

- **Memory Tracker**:  
  - **Cell State**: `0.5("I") + 0.9("love") + 1("myself")`  
  - **Hidden State**: `"I love myself"` (output)

‚úÖ **Final Output**: `"I love myself"`

## üîç Example: Acting Out a GRU (5 People)

Let‚Äôs walk through the GRU process using the input sequence:

**Input Sequence**: `"I love myself."`

### Roles (5 People)
- **Input Provider (x‚Çú)** ‚Äì Feeds words into the model.
- **Reset Gate (r‚Çú)** ‚Äì Decides how much previous memory to erase.
- **Update Gate (z‚Çú)** ‚Äì Decides how much new information to keep.
- **Candidate Memory (hÃÉ‚Çú)** ‚Äì Suggests the updated memory using new input and old memory.
- **Memory Tracker (h‚Çú)** ‚Äì Stores and shares the hidden state (output).

---

### Step 1: Time Step 1 ("I")
- **Input Provider (x‚Çú)**:  
  Passes the first input: `x‚Çú = "I"`

- **Reset Gate (r‚Çú)**:  
  No prior information‚Äîallow all input to flow.  
  ‚úÖ **Decision**: Reset = 1 (keep everything).

- **Update Gate (z‚Çú)**:  
  This is the first word, so keep it fully.  
  ‚úÖ **Decision**: Update = 1 (100% new information).

- **Candidate Memory (hÃÉ‚Çú)**:  
  Since the reset gate is open, use `"I"` as new memory.  
  ‚úÖ **Candidate Memory**: `"I"`.

- **Memory Tracker (h‚Çú)**:  
  Update memory with the new input.  
  ‚úÖ **Output**: `"I"`

‚úÖ **Output so far**: `"I"`

---

### Step 2: Time Step 2 ("love")
- **Input Provider (x‚Çú)**:  
  Passes the next input: `x‚Çú = "love"`

- **Reset Gate (r‚Çú)**:  
  `"I"` is still relevant‚Äîkeep it.  
  ‚úÖ **Decision**: Reset = 1 (keep previous information).

- **Update Gate (z‚Çú)**:  
  New input is important‚Äîpartially update.  
  ‚úÖ **Decision**: Update = 0.6 (60% new, 40% old).

- **Candidate Memory (hÃÉ‚Çú)**:  
  Mix `"I"` and `"love"` to form updated memory.  
  ‚úÖ **Candidate Memory**: `"I love"`.

- **Memory Tracker (h‚Çú)**:  
  Blend the current memory with the candidate memory:  
  `h‚Çú = 0.6("I love") + 0.4("I") = "I love"`

‚úÖ **Output so far**: `"I love"`

---

### Step 3: Time Step 3 ("myself")
- **Input Provider (x‚Çú)**:  
  Passes the next input: `x‚Çú = "myself"`

- **Reset Gate (r‚Çú)**:  
  Keep most of the past but reduce earlier context slightly.  
  ‚úÖ **Decision**: Reset = 0.8 (keep 80% of memory).

- **Update Gate (z‚Çú)**:  
  `"Myself"` is important‚Äîupdate memory significantly.  
  ‚úÖ **Decision**: Update = 0.7 (70% new, 30% old).

- **Candidate Memory (hÃÉ‚Çú)**:  
  Combine `"I love"` with `"myself."`  
  ‚úÖ **Candidate Memory**: `"I love myself"`

- **Memory Tracker (h‚Çú)**:  
  Update by blending old and new:  
  `h‚Çú = 0.7("I love myself") + 0.3("I love") = "I love myself"`

‚úÖ **Final Output**: `"I love myself"`
